                <p>The song is currently No. 58 on the Pop 100, and last week the album from which it is drawn, "Don't You Fake It" (Virgin), debuted at No. 25 on the Billboard 200.
                "Before we signed a contract [with Virgin Records], we had a meeting and the first thing I said was that I wanted 'Face Down' to be the first single," singer Ronnie Winter tells Billboard.com. "You only get one shot in life, and if I'm going to be remembered for one song for the rest of my life that's the one I want it to be."
                  </p>
                <p>The song's lyrics are deeply personal for Winter, who "grew up in that kind of environment," and he hopes his experiences can help kids who are in similar situations cope. "My grandma taught me a long time ago [that] if you can help somebody you should do it. That's all we're trying to do," he says.
                He adds that the lyrics are "probably the only reason why the song is blowing up. It's not because we look any different from any other band -- we're just a bunch of kids all dressed up, jumping around in a video and playing power chords. It's the lyrical content."
                As for the rest of the album, it "is essentially an autobiography of my life; every song is about me or somebody that I know personally. That's why I think kids can relate to it."</p>
